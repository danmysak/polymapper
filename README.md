# Polymapper

This is a simple tool for manual generation of polygonal areas based on a set of markers.

To use, put your Google Maps API key in `src/config/key.js` and run `src/index.html` in a browser. You can also try it out at [https://danmysak.github.io/polymapper/](https://danmysak.github.io/polymapper/).

Sample files for importing are available in the `samples` folder.
